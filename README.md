# Capstone-Extinction-2021

# What Our Code Includes

Within this code base, it includes all the code used to create our project for Capstone 2021, Project Perception. Our code includes various folders to help organize the code. It is broken up into components, containers, and pages. In the components folder, it includes a variety of React components which could be used to build more stories. In the containers folder, it contains the main content of the project that pulls from the components to build out the page. Lastly, in the pages folder, it contains the code that references the containers code, so that it can be displayed on the React app. There is also a constants folder which contains routes.js to put all the URLs in one place to make linking each of the different pages of the project much easier.

# How to Build The Code

A lot of the basis of the project has been prepared through the components folder where you can utilize those components to build more endangered species stories. The way our code is structured is if a component can be used for multiple page, it would be included in the components folder. In the containers folder, this is where most of the content goes and how the naming coventions work for the stories is by the endangered species and the page. The .js files that have one number represents pages that contains choices. The .js files that have two numbers represents the choice page that it is linked to and which choice is chosen. Once all the content has been added within the containers, you pass that component into the pages, which is then used to be displayed on the React App. The routes.js has constants that you continue to add if you are adding a Link to have pages connect to one another.
